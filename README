    FE-GBDS
----------------
Aim to fit the modern Windows compiling and running environment.
Now it works with Cygwin x86_64 (11.28.2015)

-----initial updates on FE-GBDS-------
For Compiling in Windows

1. Installing Cygwin if you do not have. https://cygwin.com/install.html
2. Opening your Cygwin terminal and locate to the source code folder which contains Makefile
3. Typing command make to compile all the files
4. Then you will get three executable files. They can be run within Cygwin terminal.
5. The three exe files can also be run in Windows, but cygwin1.dll is required. cygwin1.dll can be found at %YOUR-CYGWIN-PATH%/bin.

  RGBDS README
----------------

RGBDS (Rednex Game Boy Development System) is a free assembler/linker package
for the Game Boy and Game Boy Color. It consists of:

  - rgbasm  (assembler)
  - rgblink (linker)
  - rgbfix  (checksum/header fixer)

rgbds-linux is a fork of the original RGBDS which aims to make the programs
more like other UNIX tools.


  Installing RGBDS (UNIX)
=========================

To build the programs on a UNIX or UNIX-like system, just run in your terminal:

  make

Then to install the compiled programs and manual pages, run (with appropriate
privileges):

  make install

After installation, you can read the manuals with the man(1) command. E.g.,

  man 1 rgbasm


Note: the variables described below can affect installation behavior when given
on the make command line. For example, to install rgbds in your home directory
instead of systemwide, run the following:

  mkdir -p $HOME/{bin,man/man1,man/man7}
  make install PREFIX=$HOME


PREFIX: Location where RGBDS will be installed. Defaults to /usr/local.

BINPREFIX: Location where the RGBDS programs will be installed. Defaults
to ${PREFIX}/bin.

MANPREFIX: Location where the RGBDS man pages will be installed. Defaults
to ${PREFIX}/man.

Q: Whether to quiet the build or not. To make the build more verbose, clear
this variable. Defaults to @.


  Installing RGBDS (Windows)
============================

Windows builds are available here: https://github.com/bentley/rgbds/releases

Copy the .exe files to C:\Windows\ or similar.
